pattern_name: isolated

description: >-
    Some diseases exist in both isolated and syndromic forms. For example, aniridia ([MONDO_0019172 aniridia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0019172), [MONDO_0020148'syndromic aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0020148) and [MONDO_0007119 'isolated aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119). Use this pattern to define the isolated form of a disease when a term exists for the isolated/syndromic-neutral version.
    In general, this pattern should be used in parallel with syndromic. E.g. if you make a term 'syndromic disease, you should also have 'isolated disease' [see pattern here(https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/blob/master/src/patterns/dosdp-patterns/syndromic.yaml). 
    Note that the isolated and syndromic forms will be inferred to be disjoint due to the GCI pattern.

    Examples: ['isolated aniridia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0007119), ['isolated dystonia'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015494), ['isolated focal palmoplantar keratoderma'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0017673)
