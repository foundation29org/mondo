pattern_name: disease_series_by_gene

description: >-
  This pattern is for diseases that are caused by a single mutation in a single gene, that have gene-based names, such as new disease terms that are requested by ClinGen, like MED12-related intellectual disability syndrome. 
  Examples: [MED12-related intellectual disability syndrome](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100000), [TTN-related myopathy](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100175), [MYPN-related myopathy](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015023)
