description: >4-

    Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells.

    This is a Design pattern for classes representing carcinomas based
    on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
    represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.

    We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
    generalized over primary and secondary sites.
