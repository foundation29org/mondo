pattern_name: neoplasm

description: >4-

    Neoplasms are benign or malignant tissue growths resulting from
    uncontrolled cell proliferation cell types.

    This is a design pattern for classes representing neoplasms based on
    their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
    represent a secondary site for malignant neoplasms that have
    metastasized.

    We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
    generalized over primary and secondary sites.

    Note that tumor is typically a synonym for neoplasm, although this
    can be context dependent. For NETs, NCIT uses the nomenclature 'tumor'
    to indicate 'well differentiated, low or intermediate grade tumor'.
    This can also be called carcinoid, see
    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html
    We attempt to spell this out in our labels.
