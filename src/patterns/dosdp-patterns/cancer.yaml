description: >4-

    Cancers are malignant neoplasms arising from a variety of different
    cell types.

    This is a design pattern for classes representing cancers based
    on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
    represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.

    We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
    generalized over primary and secondary sites.
